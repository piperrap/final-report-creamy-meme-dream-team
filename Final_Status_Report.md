# Final Progress Report

### Describe your team activities prior to this date

Due to ambiguity with the datasets that Federal Aviation Administration has sent us, we decided to compile a list of questions that should clear up the specifics of the project. We have also created an entity relationship diagram to show our current understanding of how the entities and their functions will work in this project.

### Planned Activities

- Continue getting everyone up-to-date with information from Pluralsight
- Email Chris about more specific details about the project
- Schedule another call with Chris to discuss any updates to the working-project and project description
- Finish writing out a Vision Document with updated information
